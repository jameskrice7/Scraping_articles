The structure of the climate debate,"
Richard S. J. Tol
",2016,"  First-best climate policy is a uniform carbon tax which gradually rises over
time. Civil servants have complicated climate policy to expand bureaucracies,
politicians to create rents. Environmentalists have exaggerated climate change
to gain influence, other activists have joined the climate bandwagon. Opponents
to climate policy have attacked the weaknesses in climate research. The climate
debate is convoluted and polarized as a result, and climate policy complex.
Climate policy should become easier and more rational as the Paris Agreement
has shifted climate policy back towards national governments. Changing
political priorities, austerity, and a maturing bureaucracy should lead to a
more constructive climate debate.

Richard S. J. Tol
",2023,"  We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium
climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the
production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon
can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we
distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate
vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability
results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if
climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact
can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less
(more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not
only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost
and climate diseases.

",2021,"  Climate change perceptions are fundamental for adaptation and environmental
policy support. Although Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to
climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived
in the continent. Using random forest methodology, we analyse Afrobarometer
data (N = 45,732), joint with climatic data, to explore what shapes climate
change perceptions in Africa. We include 5 different dimensions of climate
change perceptions: awareness, belief in its human cause, risk perception, need
to stop it and self-efficacy. Results indicate that perceived agriculture
conditions are crucial for perceiving climate change. Country-level factors and
long-term changes in local weather conditions are among the most important
predictors. Moreover, education level, access to information, poverty,
authoritarian values, and trust in institutions shape individual climate change
perceptions. Demographic effects -- including religion -- seem negligible.
These findings suggest policymakers and environmental communicators how to
frame climate change in Africa to raise awareness, gather public support and

",2021,"  Climate change is a burning issue of our time, with the Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 13 of the United Nations demanding global climate
action. Realizing the urgency, in 2015 in Paris, world leaders signed an
agreement committing to taking voluntary action to reduce carbon emissions.
However, the scale, magnitude, and climate action processes vary globally,
especially between developed and developing countries. Therefore, from
parliament to social media, the debates and discussions on climate change
gather data from wide-ranging sources essential to the policy design and
implementation. The downside is that we do not currently have the mechanisms to
pool the worldwide dispersed knowledge emerging from the structured and
unstructured data sources.
  The paper thematically discusses how NLP techniques could be employed in
climate policy research and contribute to society's good at large. In
particular, we exemplify symbiosis of NLP and Climate Policy Research via four
methodologies. The first one deals with the major topics related to climate
policy using automated content analysis. We investigate the opinions
(sentiments) of major actors' narratives towards climate policy in the second
methodology. The third technique explores the climate actors' beliefs towards
pro or anti-climate orientation. Finally, we discuss developing a Climate
Knowledge Graph.
  The present theme paper further argues that creating a knowledge platform
would help in the formulation of a holistic climate policy and effective
climate action. Such a knowledge platform would integrate the policy actors'
varied opinions from different social sectors like government, business, civil
society, and the scientific community. The research outcome will add value to
effective climate action because policymakers can make informed decisions by
looking at the diverse public opinion on a comprehensive platform.

about the environment has grown. To better understand climate, historical
climate (e.g. archived meteorological variables such as temperature, wind,

Moreover, there is a lack of advanced climate data platforms to enable

Anna S. von der Heydt

Peter Ashwin
",2016,"  Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is a key predictor of climate change.
However, it is not very well constrained, either by climate models or by
observational data. The reasons for this include strong internal variability
and forcing on many time scales. In practise this means that the 'equilibrium'
will only be relative to fixing the slow feedback processes before comparing
palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations. In
addition, information from the late Pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that
the climate cycles between cold and warm regimes, and the climate sensitivity
varies considerably between regime because of fast feedback processes changing
relative strength and time scales over one cycle.
  In this paper we consider climate sensitivity for quite general climate
dynamics. Using a conceptual Earth system model of Gildor and Tziperman (2001)
(with Milankovich forcing and dynamical ocean biogeochemistry) we explore
various ways of quantifying the state-dependence of climate sensitivity from
unperturbed and perturbed model time series. Even without considering any
perturbations, we suggest that climate sensitivity can be usefully thought of
as a distribution that quantifies variability within the 'climate attractor'
and where there is a strong dependence on climate state and more specificially
on the 'climate regime' where fast processes are approximately in equilibrium.
We also consider perturbations by instantaneous doubling of CO$_2$ and
similarly find a strong dependence on the climate state using our approach.

released including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents.
The use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be
reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we
suspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in
Overton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on
policy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents

The Role of Uncertainty in Controlling Climate Change,"
Yongyang Cai
",2020,"  Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of the climate and economy aim to analyze
the impact and efficacy of policies that aim to control climate change, such as
carbon taxes and subsidies. A major characteristic of IAMs is that their
geophysical sector determines the mean surface temperature increase over the
preindustrial level, which in turn determines the damage function. Most of the
existing IAMs are perfect-foresight forward-looking models, assuming that we
know all of the future information. However, there are significant
uncertainties in the climate and economic system, including parameter
uncertainty, model uncertainty, climate tipping risks, economic risks, and
ambiguity. For example, climate damages are uncertain: some researchers assume
that climate damages are proportional to instantaneous output, while others
assume that climate damages have a more persistent impact on economic growth.
Climate tipping risks represent (nearly) irreversible climate events that may
lead to significant changes in the climate system, such as the Greenland ice
sheet collapse, while the conditions, probability of tipping, duration, and
associated damage are also uncertain. Technological progress in carbon capture
and storage, adaptation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency are uncertain
too. In the face of these uncertainties, policymakers have to provide a
decision that considers important factors such as risk aversion, inequality
aversion, and sustainability of the economy and ecosystem. Solving this problem
may require richer and more realistic models than standard IAMs, and advanced
computational methods. The recent literature has shown that these uncertainties
can be incorporated into IAMs and may change optimal climate policies

challenges. Unless proactive measures based on solid evidence are implemented,
these threats will likely escalate and continue to endanger human well-being.
The escalating advancements in information and communication technologies have
facilitated the widespread availability and utilization of social media
platforms. Individuals utilize platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to
express their opinions, thoughts, and critiques on diverse subjects,
encompassing the pressing issue of climate change. The proliferation of climate
change-related content on social media necessitates comprehensive analysis to
glean meaningful insights. This paper employs natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to analyze climate change discourse and quantify the sentiment of
climate change-related tweets. We use ClimateBERT, a pretrained model
fine-tuned specifically for the climate change domain. The objective is to
discern the sentiment individuals express and uncover patterns in public
opinion concerning climate change. Analyzing tweet sentiments allows a deeper
comprehension of public perceptions, concerns, and emotions about this critical
global challenge. The findings from this experiment unearth valuable insights
into public sentiment and the entities associated with climate change
discourse. Policymakers, researchers, and organizations can leverage such
analyses to understand public perceptions, identify influential actors, and
devise informed strategies to address climate change challenges.

Climate-Contingent Finance,"
John Nay
",2022,"  Climate adaptation could yield significant benefits. However, the uncertainty
of which future climate scenarios will occur decreases the feasibility of
proactively adapting. Climate adaptation projects could be underwritten by
benefits paid for in the climate scenarios that each adaptation project is
designed to address because other entities would like to hedge the financial
risk of those scenarios. Because the return on investment is a function of the
level of climate change, it is optimal for the adapting entity to finance
adaptation with repayment as a function of the climate. It is also optimal for
entities with more financial downside under a more extreme climate to serve as
an investing counterparty because they can obtain higher than market rates of
return when they need it most.
  In this way, parties proactively adapting would reduce the risk they
over-prepare, while their investors would reduce the risk they under-prepare.
This is superior to typical insurance because, by investing in
climate-contingent mechanisms, investors are not merely financially hedging but
also outright preventing physical damage, and therefore creating economic
value. This coordinates capital through time and place according to parties'
risk reduction capabilities and financial profiles, while also providing a
diversifying investment return.
  Climate-contingent finance can be generalized to any situation where entities
share exposure to a risk where they lack direct control over whether it occurs
(e.g., climate change, or a natural pandemic), and one type of entity can take
proactive actions to benefit from addressing the effects of the risk if it
occurs (e.g., through innovating on crops that would do well under extreme
climate change or vaccination technology that could address particular viruses)
with funding from another type of entity that seeks a targeted return to
ameliorate the downside.

",2016,"  The literature on the costs of climate change often draws a link between
climatic 'tipping points' and large economic shocks, frequently called
'catastrophes'. The use of the phrase 'tipping points' in this context can be
misleading. In popular and social scientific discourse, 'tipping points'
involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic 'tipping points,' the
commitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be
rate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the
connection between climatic 'tipping points' and economic losses is tenuous,
though emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for
investigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between
'tipping points' in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by
climatic and social 'tipping elements,' and 'economic shocks'. The last may be
associated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or non-climatic
triggers. We illustrate our proposed distinctions by surveying the literature

used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output,
but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully
coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for
simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here, we focus on these issues
using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on
output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in
simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as
the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures
conservation of energy and non-negativity of surface precipitation. The GCM
with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures
important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need
for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and
a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on
the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from
both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only
on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate
provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition
to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML
parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction

MickaÃ«l Chekroun
",2023,"  Klaus Hasselmann's revolutionary intuition in climate science was to take
advantage of the stochasticity associated with fast weather processes to probe
the slow dynamics of the climate system. This has led to fundamentally new ways
to study the response of climate models to perturbations, and to perform
detection and attribution for climate change signals. Hasselmann's program has
been extremely influential in climate science and beyond. We first summarise
the main aspects of such a program using modern concepts and tools of
statistical physics and applied mathematics. We then provide an overview of
some promising scientific perspectives that might better clarify the science
behind the climate crisis and that stem from Hasselmann's ideas. We show how to
perform rigorous model reduction by constructing parametrizations in systems
that do not necessarily feature a time-scale separation between unresolved and
resolved processes. We propose a general framework for explaining the
relationship between climate variability and climate change, and for performing
climate change projections. This leads us seamlessly to explain some key
general aspects of climatic tipping points. Finally, we show that response
theory provides a solid framework supporting optimal fingerprinting methods for
detection and attribution.

",2023,"  Emissions pathways used in climate policy analysis are often derived from
integrated assessment models. However, such emissions pathways do not typically
include climate feedbacks on socioeconomic systems and by extension do not
consider climate uncertainty in their construction. We use a well-known
cost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated
Climate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the
Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty
in FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically
observed climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed
ranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity. Three
scenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the ""optimal welfare"" scenario of
DICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that
limit warming to ""well-below"" 2C and 1.5C with low overshoot, in line with
Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals. Climate uncertainty alone is
responsible for a factor of five variation (5-95% range) in the social cost of
carbon in the 1.5C scenario. CO2 emissions trajectories resulting from the
optimal level of emissions abatement in all pathways are also sensitive to
climate uncertainty, with 2050 emissions ranging from -12 to +14 GtCO2/yr in
the 1.5C scenario. Equilibrium climate sensitivity and the strength of
present-day aerosol effective radiative forcing are strong determinants of
social cost of carbon and mid-century CO2 emissions. This shows that narrowing
climate uncertainty leads to more refined estimates for the social cost of
carbon and provides more certainty about the optimal rate of emissions
abatement. Including climate and climate uncertainty in integrated assessment
model derived emissions scenarios would address a key missing feedback in
scenario construction.

",2016,"  Range expansion and range shifts are crucial population responses to climate
change. Genetic consequences are not well understood but are clearly coupled to
ecological dynamics that, in turn, are driven by shifting climate conditions.
We model a population with a deterministic reaction-- diffusion model coupled
to a heterogeneous environment that develops in time due to climate change. We
decompose the resulting travelling wave solution into neutral genetic
components to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of its genetic structure.
Our analysis shows that range expansions and range shifts under slow climate
change preserve genetic diversity. This is because slow climate change creates
range boundaries that promote spatial mixing of genetic components.
Mathematically , the mixing leads to so-called pushed travelling wave
solutions. This mixing phenomenon is not seen in spatially homogeneous
environments, where range expansion reduces genetic diversity through gene
surfing arising from pulled travelling wave solutions. However, the
preservation of diversity is diminished when climate change occurs too quickly.
Using diversity indices, we show that fast expansions and range shifts erode
genetic diversity more than slow range expansions and range shifts. Our study
provides analytical insight into the dynamics of travelling wave solutions in
heterogeneous environments.

Here we apply different damage functions to data from climate models with

In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on

parameterizations that crudely but efficiently approximate these processes are
a leading source of uncertainty in long-term projected warming and
precipitation patterns. Machine Learning (ML)-based parameterizations have long
been hailed as a promising alternative with the potential to yield higher
accuracy at a fraction of the cost of more explicit simulations. However, these
ML variants are often unpredictably unstable and inaccurate in \textit{coupled}
testing (i.e. in a downstream hybrid simulation task where they are dynamically
interacting with the large-scale climate model). These issues are exacerbated
in out-of-distribution climates. Certain design decisions such as
``climate-invariant"" feature transformation for moisture inputs, input vector
expansion, and temporal history incorporation have been shown to improve
coupled performance, but they may be insufficient for coupled
out-of-distribution generalization. If feature selection and transformations
can inoculate hybrid physics-ML climate models from non-physical,
out-of-distribution extrapolation in a changing climate, there is far greater
potential in extrapolating from observational data. Otherwise, training on
multiple simulated climates becomes an inevitable necessity. While our results

level change in the future, we turn to climate model simulations. This work
presents a machine learning framework that exploits both satellite observations

",2019,"  Decisions related to electric power systems planning and operations rely on
assumptions and insights informed by historic weather data and records of past
performance. Evolving climate trends are, however, changing the energy use
patterns and operating conditions of grid assets, thus altering the nature and
severity of risks the system faces. Because grid assets remain in operation for
decades, planning for evolving risks will require incorporating climate
projections into grid infrastructure planning processes. The current work
traces a pathway for climate-aware decision-making in the electricity sector.
We evaluate the suitability of using existing climate models and data for
electricity planning and discuss their limitations. We review the interactions
between grid infrastructure and climate by synthesizing what is known about how
changing environmental operating conditions would impact infrastructure
utilization, constraints, and performance. We contextualize our findings by
presenting a case study of California, examining if and where climate data can
be integrated into infrastructure planning processes. The core contribution of
the work is a series of nine recommendations detailing advancements in climate
projections, grid modeling architecture, and disaster preparedness that would
be needed to ensure that infrastructure planning decisions are robust to
uncertainty and risks associated with evolving climate conditions.

public support for increasing the use of nuclear energy where climate change
risk perception is no longer the sole decisive feature. Our findings indicate
that public support for renewable energy is inherently different from that for

on forest productivity and health are complicated by potential interactions
with disturbance events and stand dynamics. The effects of stand dynamics on
forest responses to climate and disturbance are particularly important given
forest characteristics driven by stand dynamics can be modified through forest
management with the goal of increasing forest resistance and resilience to
climate change. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model allowing
climate effects on tree growth to vary over time and in relation to climate
extremes, disturbance events, and stand dynamics. We apply the model to a
dendrochronology dataset comprising measurements from forest stands of varying
composition, structure, and development stage in northeastern Minnesota.
Results indicate average forest growth was most sensitive to variables
describing climatic water deficit. Forest growth responses to water deficit
were partitioned into responses driven by climatic threshold exceedances and
interactions with forest tent caterpillar defoliation. Forest growth was both
resistant and resilient to climate extremes with the majority of forest growth
responses occurring after multiple climatic threshold exceedances or insect
defoliation events. Forest growth was most sensitive to water deficit during
periods of high stem density following major regeneration events when average
inter-tree competition was high. Results suggest that forest growth resistance
and resilience to interactions between climate extremes and insect defoliation
can be increased through management steps such as thinning to reduce
competition during early stages of stand development and small-group selection
harvests to maintain forest structures characteristic of older, mature stands.

Could Cirrus Clouds Have Warmed Early Mars?,"

",2016,"  The presence of the ancient valley networks on Mars indicates that the
climate at 3.8 Ga was warm enough to allow substantial liquid water to flow on
the martian surface for extended periods of time. However, the mechanism for
producing this warming continues to be debated. One hypothesis is that Mars
could have been kept warm by global cirrus cloud decks in a CO2-H2O atmosphere
containing at least 0.25 bar of CO2 (Urata and Toon, 2013). Initial warming
from some other process, e.g., impacts, would be required to make this model
work. Those results were generated using the CAM 3-D global climate model.
Here, we use a single-column radiative-convective climate model to further
investigate the cirrus cloud warming hypothesis. Our calculations indicate that
cirrus cloud decks could have produced global mean surface temperatures above
freezing, but only if cirrus cloud cover approaches ~75 - 100% and if other
cloud properties (e.g., height, optical depth, particle size) are chosen
favorably. However, at more realistic cirrus cloud fractions, or if cloud
parameters are not optimal, cirrus clouds do not provide the necessary warming,
suggesting that other greenhouse mechanisms are needed.

",2020,"  Global warming, the phenomenon of increasing global average temperature in
the recent decades, is receiving wide attention due to its very significant
adverse effects on climate. Whether global warming will continue even in the
future, is a question that is most important to investigate. In this regard,
the so-called general circulation models (GCMs) have attempted to project the
future climate, and nearly all of them exhibit alarming rates of global
temperature rise in the future.
  Although global warming in the current time frame is undeniable, it is
important to assess the validity of the future predictions of the GCMs. In this
article, we attempt such a study using our recently-developed Bayesian multiple
testing paradigm for model selection in inverse regression problems. The model
we assume for the global temperature time series is based on Gaussian process
emulation of the black box scenario, realistically treating the dynamic
evolution of the time series as unknown.
  We apply our ideas to datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) website. The best GCM models selected by our method under
different assumptions on future climate change scenarios do not convincingly
support the present global warming pattern when only the future predictions are
considered known. Using our Gaussian process idea, we also forecast the future
temperature time series given the current one. Interestingly, our results do
not support drastic future global warming predicted by almost all the GCM

net increase of total GHG (34.80 mW m^(-2)) but more that of CO2 (24.43 mW

",2022,"  Climate change is predicted to lead to major changes in terrestrial
ecosystems. However, significant differences in climate model projections for
given scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, continue to hinder detailed
assessment. Here we show, using a traditional Koppen-Geiger bioclimate
classification system, that the latest CMIP6 Earth System Models actually agree
very well on the fraction of the global land-surface that will undergo a
significant change per degree of global warming. Data from historical and
ssp585 model runs are used to create bioclimate maps at various degrees of
global warming, and to investigate the performance of the ensemble mean when
classifying climate data into discrete categories. Using a streamlined scheme
with 13 classifications, global bioclimate classification maps at 2K and 4K of
global warming above a 1901-1931 reference period are presented. These
projections show large shifts in bioclimate distribution, with an almost
exclusive change from colder, wetter bioclimates to hotter, dryer ones.
Historical model run performance is assessed and examined by comparison with
the bioclimatic classifications derived from the observed climate over the same
time period. The fraction of the land experiencing a change in its bioclimatic
class as a function of global warming is estimated by combining the results
from the individual models. Despite the discrete nature of the bioclimatic
classification scheme, we find only a weakly-saturating dependence of this
fraction on global warming which implies about 12 pct of land experiencing a
significant change in climate, per 1K increase in global mean temperature
between the global warming levels of 1 and 3K. Therefore, we estimate that
stabilising the climate at 1.5K rather than 2K of global warming, would save
over 7 million square kilometres of land from a major bioclimatic change.

observed datasets of global lower stratospheric temperature (GLST),
troposphere-stratosphere temperature climatology, global land surface air
temperature, GMST, sea ice extent (SIE) and snow cover extent (SCE), combined
with modeled calculations of GLSTs and GMSTs. The observed and analyzed results
show that GLST/SCE has stabilized since the mid-1990s with no significant
change over the past two and a half decades. Upper stratospheric warming at
high latitudes has been observed and GMST or global land surface air
temperature has reached a plateau since the mid-2000s with the removal of
natural effects. In marked contrast, continued drastic warmings at the coasts
of polar regions (particularly Russia and Alaska) are observed and well
explained by the sea-ice-loss warming amplification mechanism. The calculated
GMSTs by the parameter-free quantum-physics warming model of halogenated
greenhouse gases (GHGs) show excellent agreement with the observed GMSTs after
the natural El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) and volcanic effects are
removed. These results have provided strong evidence for the dominant warming
mechanism of anthropogenic halogenated GHGs. The results also call for closer

",2024,"  In the X-ray spectra of AGNs, a noticeable excess of soft X-rays is typically
detected beyond the extrapolation of the power-law trend observed between 2-10
keV. In the scenario of warm Comptonization, observations propose a warm corona
temperature ranging from 0.1-1 keV and an optical depth of approximately 10-20.
Furthermore, according to radiative constraints derived from spectral analyses
employing Comptonization models, it is suggested that the majority of the
accretion power is released within the warm corona, while the disk beneath it
is largely non-dissipative, emitting mainly the reprocessed radiation from the
corona. We test the dissipative warm corona model using the radiative transfer
code-TITAN/NOAR on a sample of 82 XMM-Newton observations of AGNs. Through
spectral modeling of the X-ray data, we aim to estimate the total amount of
internal heating inside the warm corona situated on top of the accretion disk.
By modeling the 0.3-10 keV EPIC-pn spectra, we estimate the internal heating
and optical depth of the warm corona and check their correlations with global
parameters blackhole parameters. From model normalization, we compute the
radial extent of warm corona on top of cold accretion disk. Our model infers
the presence of dissipative warm corona, with optical depths distributed in the
range 6-30 and total internal heating in the range 1-29 x 1e-23 erg/s-cm3. The
extent of warm corona is spread across a large range from 7-408 gravitational
radii, and we find that warm corona is more extended for larger accretion
rates. Soft excess emission is ubiquitous in AGNs across wide mass range and
accretion rate. We confirm that warm corona responsible for producing the
soft-excess is highly dissipative in nature with larger optical depths being
associated with lower internal heating and vice versa. The cold standard

pathway (SSP) scenario used for the simulations. However a substantial number
of CMIP6 GCMs run ""too hot"" because they appear to be too sensitive to
radiative forcing, and that the high/extreme emission scenarios SSP3-7.0 and
SSP5-8.5 must be rejected because judged to be ""unlikely"" and ""highly

""realistic"" climate change projections for the 21st century generated by
assessing the theoretical models and integrating them with the existing
empirical knowledge on global warming and the various natural cycles of climate
change that have been recorded by a variety of scientists and historians. This
is achieved by combining the ""realistic"" SSP2-4.5 scenario and empirically
optimized climate modeling. The obtained climate projections show that the
expected global surface warming for the 21st century will likely be mild, that
is, no more than 2.5-3.0 {\deg}C and, on average, likely below the 2.0 {\deg}C
threshold. This should allow for the mitigation and management of the most
dangerous climate-change-related hazards through appropriate low-cost
adaptation policies. In conclusion, enforcing expensive decarbonization and
net-zero emission scenarios, such as SSP1-2.6, is not required because the
Paris Agreement temperature target of keeping global warming below 2 {\deg}C
throughout the 21st century should be compatible also with moderate and

open the door to the need for a non-uniform causal-effect climate analysis that
goes beyond the standard causality in mean as well as for a more efficient

the 21st century, rapid reductions in methane emissions early in the 21st
century could have far reaching effects. We use a reduced complexity carbon
cycle model and a permafrost feedback module to explore the possibility that
accelerating reductions in methane emissions could help avoid long-term warming
by limiting permafrost melt. We simulate 3 extended Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 6) through
the year 2300 and impose methane mitigation strategies where we reduce CH4
emissions by 1%, 5% or 10% annually until the long-term scenario emission level
is reached. We find that accelerated rates of methane mitigation do not
sufficiently alter the global temperature anomaly to prevent or delay a
permafrost feedback, nor do they result in meaningful long term reductions in
temperatures. We find that the long-term magnitude of methane mitigation (i.e.,
long-term emission level) and not the rate of reduction, corresponds to
long-term temperature change. Therefore, policy and mitigation efforts should
emphasize durable decreases in methane emissions over rapidity of
implementation.

CMIP6 GCM ensemble members versus global surface temperatures,"
Nicola Scafetta
",2022,"  The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (phase 6) (CMIP6) global
circulation models (GCMs) predict equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) values
ranging between 1.8 and 5.7 $^\circ$C. To narrow this range, we group 38 GCMs
into low, medium and high ECS subgroups and test their accuracy and precision
in hindcasting the mean global surface warming observed from 1980-1990 to
2011-2021 in the ERA5 T2m, HadCRUT5, GISTEMP v4, and NOAAGlobTemp v5 global
surface temperature records. We also compare the GCM hindcasts to the
satellite-based UAH MSU v6 lower troposphere global temperature record. We use
143 GCM ensemble averaged simulations under four slightly different forcing
conditions, 688 GCM member simulations, and Monte Carlo modeling of the
internal variability of the GCMs under three different model accuracy
requirements. We found that the medium and high ECS GCMs run too hot up to over
95% and 97% of cases, respectively. The low ECS GCM group agrees best with the
warming values obtained from the surface temperature records, ranging between
0.52 and 0.58 $^\circ$C. However, when comparing the observed and GCM
hindcasted warming on land and ocean regions, the surface-based temperature
records appear to exhibit a significant warming bias. If the satellite based
UAH MSU lt record is accurate, actual surface warming from 1980 to 2021 may
have been around 0.40 $^\circ$C (or less), i.e. up to about 30% less than what
is reported by the surface based temperature records. The latter situation
implies that even the low ECS models would have produced excessive warming from
1980 to 2021. These results suggest that the actual ECS may be relatively low,
i.e. lower than 3 $^\circ$C or even less than 2 $^\circ$C. Therefore, the
projected global climate warming over the next few decades could be moderate
and probably not particularly alarming.

velocities as properties of warm dark matter particles like sterile neutrinos
imprint a distinct signature found from the structure formation mechanisms to
the internal structures of halos. Using warm dark matter simulations we explore
these effects on the structure formation for different particle energies and we
find that the formation of structure is more complex than originally assumed, a
combination of top-down collapse and hierarchical (bottom-up) clustering on
multiple scales. The degree on which one scenario is more prominent with
respect to the other depends globally on the energy of the particle and locally
on the morphology and architecture of the analyzed region. The presence of
shells and caustics in warm dark matter halos is another important effect seen
in simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of thermal velocities on the
structure formation from theoretical considerations as well as from the
analysis of the simulations. We re-examine the assumptions considered when
estimating the velocity dispersion for warm dark matter particles that have
been adopted in previous works for more than a decade and we give an
independent estimation for the velocities. We identify some inconsistencies in
previous published results. The relation between the warm dark matter particle
mass and its corresponding velocity dispersion is strongly model dependent,
hence the constraints on particle mass from simulation results are weak.
Finally, we review the technical difficulties that arise in warm dark matter
simulations along with possible improvements of the methods.

A price on warming with a supply chain directed market,"
John F. Raffensperger
",2020,"  Existing emissions trading system (ETS) designs inhibit emissions but do not
constrain warming to any fxed level, preventing certainty of the global path of
warming. Instead, they have the indirect objective of reducing emissions. They
provide poor future price information. And they have high transaction costs for
implementation, requiring treaties and laws. To address these shortcomings,
this paper proposes a novel double-sided auction mechanism of emissions permits
and sequestration contracts tied to temperature. This mechanism constrains
warming for many (e.g., 150) years into the future and every auction would
provide price information for this time range. In addition, this paper proposes
a set of market rules and a bottom-up implementation path. A coalition of
businesses begin implementation with jurisdictions joining as they are ready.
The combination of the selected market rules and the proposed implementation
path appear to incentivize participation. This design appears to be closer to
""first best"" with a lower cost of mitigation than any in the literature, while
increasing the certainty of avoiding catastrophic warming. This design should
also have a faster pathway to implementation. A numerical simulation shows
surprising results, e.g., that static prices are wrong, prices should evolve
over time in a way that contradicts other recent proposals, and ""global warming
potential"" as used in existing ETSs are generally erroneous.

Estimate of the Globing Warming Caused by the Retreat of Polar Sea Ice,"

",2018,"  The growing concentrations of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O (GHG) in
the atmosphere are often considered as the dominant cause for the global
warming during the past decades. The reported temperature data however do not
display a simple correlation with the concentration changes since 1880 so that
other reasons are to be considered to contribute notably. An important feature
in this context is the shrinking of the polar ice caps observed in recent
years. We have studied the direct effect of the loss of global sea ice since
1955 on the mean global temperature estimating the corresponding decrease of
the terrestrial albedo. Using a simple 1-dimensional model the global warming
of the surface is computed that is generated by the increase of GHG and the
albedo change. A modest effect by the GHG of 0.08 K is calculated for the
period 1880 to 1955 with a further increase by 0.18K for 1955 to 2015. A larger
contribution of 0.55 +/-0.05 K is estimated for the melting of polar sea ice
(MSI) in the latter period, i.e. it notably exceeds that of the GHG and may be
compared with the observed global temperature rise of 1.0 +/- 0.1 K during the
past 60 years. Our data also suggest a delayed response of the mean global
temperature to the loss of sea ice with a time constant of approximately 20
years. The validity of the theoretical model and the interrelation between
GHG-warming and MSI-effect are discussed.

achieved, a widespread assumption is that economic growth at current rates can
be sustained beyond the 21st century. However, even if we achieve these goals,
this article shows that the overall size of Earth's global economy is facing an
upper limit purely due to energy and thermodynamic factors. For that, we break
down global warming into two components: the greenhouse gas effect and heat
dissipation from energy consumption related to economic activities. For the
temperature increase due to greenhouse gas emissions, we take 2 {\deg}C and 5
{\deg}C as our lower and upper bounds. For the warming effect of heat
dissipation related to energy consumption, we use a simplified model for global
warming and an extrapolation of the historical correlation between global gross
domestic product (GDP) and primary energy production. Combining the two
effects, we set the acceptable global warming temperature limit to 7 {\deg}C
above pre-industrial levels. We develop four scenarios, based on the viability
of large-scale deployment of carbon-neutral energy sources. Our results
indicate that for a 2% annual GDP growth, the upper limit will be reached at
best within a few centuries, even in favorable scenarios where new energy
sources such as fusion power are deployed on a massive scale. We conclude that
unless GDP can be largely decoupled from energy consumption, thermodynamics
will put a hard cap on the size of Earth's economy. Further economic growth
would necessarily require expanding economic activities into space.

nonparametric bound in all the setups that we consider.
  Finally, exploiting the property that the summands tend to zero in the case

presents how PV surfaces can be designed to reverse the Earth's radiative
imbalance from increased greenhouse gasses that lead to higher global
temperatures. The new PV surface generate electricity, reflect sub-band gap
radiation, minimize their temperature, generate thermal radiation and emit
additional IR through the atmospheric, with these processes totaling 650
Wm$^{-2}$. This is realized by: (1) PV system efficiency at operating
temperature $>$ 20 \% and sub-band gap reflection of 150 Wm$^{-2}$ for a total
of 350 Wm$^{-2}$ (2) Thermally emitted radiation (radiative cooling) of 150
Wm$^{-2}$; and (3) Active IR emission through an atmospheric window at 1.5

",2020,"  Cumulative emissions accounting for carbon-dioxide (CO2) is founded on
recognition that global warming in Earth System Models (ESMs) is roughly
proportional to cumulative CO2 emissions, regardless of emissions pathway.
However, cumulative emissions accounting only requires the graph between global
warming and cumulative emissions to be approximately independent of emissions
pathway (""path-independence""), regardless of functional relationship between
these variables. The concept and mathematics of path-independence are
considered for an energy-balance climate model (EBM), giving rise to a
closed-form expression of global warming, together with analysis of the
atmospheric cycle following emissions. Path-independence depends on the ratio
between the period of the emissions cycle and the atmospheric lifetime, being a
valid approximation if the emissions cycle has period comparable to or shorter
than the atmospheric lifetime. This makes cumulative emissions accounting
potentially relevant beyond CO2, to other greenhouse gases (GHGs) with
lifetimes of several decades whose emissions have recently begun.

",2016,"  Global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea
level, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location
requires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial
Holocene range. However, global temperature excluding short-term variability
now exceeds +1degC relative to the 1880-1920 mean and annual 2016 global
temperature was almost +1.3degC. We show that global temperature has risen well
out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as during the prior
interglacial, when sea level reached 6-9 meters higher than today. Further,
Earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying
more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse
gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity
of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to
predict but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting
global warming should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or
higher levels for centuries. Such targets require ""negative emissions"",
extraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins
soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices may provide much of the
extraction, and the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion
above the natural range of the current interglacial could be limited and
irreversible impacts minimized. In contrast, continued high emissions place a
burden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction to
limit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction have
minimal estimated costs of 89-535 trillion dollars this century and have large
risks and uncertain feasibility. Continued high emissions unarguably sentences
young people to a massive, implausible cleanup, growing deleterious climate

Ladislav Kristoufek
",2016,"  We study time evolution of the relationship between sunspot numbers and
global temperatures between 1880 and 2016 using wavelet coherence framework.
The results suggest that the relationship is stable in time. Changes in the
sunspot numbers precede changes in the temperatures by more than two years as
suggested by the wavelet phase differences. This leading position of the sun
activity is stable in time as well. However, the relationship has been
disturbed by increasing $CO_2$ emissions since 1960s. Without controlling for
the effect of possible global warming, or more precisely the positive
connection between increasing $CO_2$ emissions and the global temperatures, the
findings would have been quite different. Combination of the cointegration
analysis and wavelet coherence framework has enabled uncovering a hidden
relationship between the solar activity and global temperatures, and possibly
explaining equivocal results in the topical literature.

Science Behind Observations,"
Slavoljub Mijovic
",2023,"  Global climate change is one of main concern of modern society. To estimate
this change usually one estimates the global mean temperature. Measuring and
calculating the Earth's average temperature are multi-steps complex processes
which combine data from various sources and use statistical techniques.
Nowadays, the dataset containing the spatial-temporal data about Earth's
temperature is readily to use. Although scientists claim that to be able to
achieve an accuracy of a few tenths of a degree, the main question is not the
accuracy but, does the global mean temperature make sense at all? It is shown
that the existing methodology of determining the global mean temperature is
quite inappropriate and in long term creating wrong science. A new methodology
is introduced, concerning energy budget of heating and cooling of the Earth.
The total influence of the atmosphere in global warming can be easily estimate
by comparison with the Moon's temperature as a bare body. 'The potential
temperature for cooling' is introduced as a right parameter to estimate global
warming trend and climate change. Using the new methodology in temperature's
averaging, many surprising results would be expected and would give right
insight about the climate change.

",2021,"  Quantifying the risk of global warming exceeding critical targets such as 2.0
K requires reliable projections of uncertainty as well as best estimates of
Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST). However, uncertainty bands on GMST
projections are often calculated heuristically and have several potential
shortcomings. In particular, the uncertainty bands shown in IPCC plume
projections of GMST are based on the distribution of GMST anomalies from
climate model runs and so are strongly determined by model characteristics with
little influence from observations of the real-world. Physically motivated
time-series approaches are proposed based on fitting energy balance models
(EBMs) to climate model outputs and observations in order to constrain future
projections. It is shown that EBMs fitted to one forcing scenario will not
produce reliable projections when different forcing scenarios are applied. The
errors in the EBM projections can be interpreted as arising due to a
discrepancy in the effective forcing felt by the model. A simple time-series
approach to correcting the projections is proposed based on learning the
evolution of the forcing discrepancy so that it can be projected into the
future. These approaches give reliable projections of GMST when tested in a
perfect model setting, and when applied to observations lead to well
constrained projections with lower mean warming and narrower projection bands
than previous estimates. Despite the reduced uncertainty, the lower warming
leads to a greatly reduced probability of exceeding the 2.0 K warming target.

surface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of
regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface
temperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),
ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent
(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by
a conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)
and 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and
Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since
2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide
fingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar
(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both
surface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016
once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,
which caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by
the positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to
improved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated
results by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose
destruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven
reaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of
rapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic
amplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that
started at the end of 2023.

",2024,"  Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in
luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft
X-rays are emitted from a warm ($T=10^6\sim10^7\ \rm{K}$) region that is
optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region).
Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing
look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad
emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global
three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations assuming that the
mass accretion rate increases and becomes around $10$\% of the Eddington
accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick
region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black
hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse
Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity $0.01L_{{\rm Edd}}-0.08L_{{\rm
Edd}}$ is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm
Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks
supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the anti-parallel azimuthal
magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the
equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by
releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.

remains unclear whether atmospheric dust has a net warming or cooling effect on
global climate. Consequently, it is still uncertain whether large changes in
atmospheric dust loading over the past century have slowed or accelerated
anthropogenic climate change, or what the effects of potential future changes
in dust loading will be. Here we present an analysis of the size and abundance

observational data on dust abundance, in situ measurements of dust optical
properties and size distribution, and climate and atmospheric chemical
transport model simulations of dust lifetime, we find that the dust found in
the atmosphere is substantially coarser than represented in current global

radiative effect is likely to be less cooling than the ~-0.4 W/m2 estimated by
models in a current global aerosol model ensemble. Instead, we constrain the
dust direct radiative effect to a range between -0.48 and +0.20 W/m2, which
includes the possibility that dust causes a net warming of the planet.

underestimates methane emission metrics by 34-38% relative to the values we

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This paper contains self consistent modeling of
both: accretion disk with optically thick corona, where the gas is heated by
magneto-rotational instability dynamo (MRI), and cooled by radiation which
undergoes free-free absorption and Compton scattering. Aims. We determine the
parameters of warm corona in AGN using disk-corona structure model that takes
into account magnetic and radiation pressure. We aim to show the role of
thermal instability (TI) as a constraint for warm, optically thick X-ray corona
in AGN. Methods. With the use of relaxation code, the vertical solution of the
disk driven by MRI together with radiative transfer in hydrostatic and
radiative equilibrium is calculated, which allows us to point out how TI
affects the corona for wide range of global parameters. Results. We show that
magnetic heating is strong enough to heat upper layers of the accretion disk
atmosphere, which form the warm corona covering the disk. Magnetic pressure
does not remove TI caused by radiative processes operating in X-ray emitting
plasma. TI disappears only in case of accretion rates higher than 0.2 of
Eddington, and high magnetic field parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$ > 0.1.
Conclusions. TI plays the major role in the formation of the warm corona above
magnetically driven accretion disk in AGN. The warm, Compton cooled corona,
responsible for soft X-ray excess, resulted from our model has typical
temperature in the range of 0.01 - 2 keV and optical depth even up to 50, which

system causing global concern. Quantifying planetary warming from carbon
emissions, global climate models highlight natural forests' high carbon storage
potential supporting conservation policies. However, some model outcomes
effectively deprioritize conservation of boreal and temperate forests
suggesting that increased albedo upon deforestation could cool the planet.
Potential conflict of global cooling versus regional forest conservation could
harm environmental policies. Here we present theoretical and observational
evidence to demonstrate that, compared to the carbon-related warming, the model
skills for assessing climatic impacts of deforestation is low. We argue that
deforestation-induced global cooling results from the models' limited capacity
to account for the global effect of cooling from evapotranspiration of intact
forests. Transpiration of trees can change the greenhouse effect via small
modifications of the vertical temperature profile. Due to their convective
parameterization (which postulates a certain critical temperature profile),
global climate models do not properly capture this effect. This
parameterization may lead to underestimation of warming from the loss of
evapotranspiration in both high and low latitidues, and therefore, conclusions
about deforestation-induced global cooling are not robust. To avoid deepening
the environmental crisis, these conclusions should not inform policies of
vegetation cover management. Studies are mounting quantifying the stabilizing
impact of natural ecosystems evolved to maintain environmental homeostasis.
Given the critical state and our limited understanding of both climate and
ecosystems, an optimal policy would be a global moratorium on the exploitation

near-surface relative humidity to global warming: relative humidity tends to
increase slightly over oceans but decrease substantially over land. Surface
energy balance arguments have been used to understand the response over ocean
but are difficult to apply over more complex land surfaces. Here, a conceptual
box model is introduced, involving moisture transport between the land and
ocean boundary layers and evapotranspiration, to investigate the decreases in
land relative humidity as the climate warms. The box model is applied to
idealized and full-complexity (CMIP5) general circulation model simulations,
and it is found to capture many of the features of the simulated changes in
land relative humidity. The box model suggests there is a strong link between
fractional changes in specific humidity over land and ocean, and the greater
warming over land than ocean then implies a decrease in land relative humidity.
Evapotranspiration is of secondary importance for the increase in specific
humidity over land, but it matters more for the decrease in relative humidity.
Further analysis shows there is a strong feedback between changes in

small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the
observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the
models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated
internal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice
changes during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model
Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close
relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea
ice extent. We find that all of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice
retreat as fast as observed have considerably more global warming than
observations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate
the sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming
in each simulation in both ensembles, we find that simulated Arctic sea ice
retreat as fast as observed would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies
that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, we
find that simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observed typically corresponds
with too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. We
show that because of this, the simulations do not capture the observed

greater warming from the added contrails. These findings highlight the
necessity of considering temporal factors, such as the timing and duration of
contrail formation, when assessing their overall warming impact. They also
indicate a potential increase in contrail-induced warming from 2023 to 2024,
attributable to the rise in contrail coverage. Further investigation into these
trends is crucial for the development of effective mitigation strategies.

",2015,"  Principal Hugoniot and K-shell X-ray absorption spectra of warm dense KCl are
calculated using the first-principles molecular dynamics method. Evolution of
electronic structures as well as the influence of the approximate description
of ionization on pressure (caused by the underestimation of the energy gap
between conduction bands and valence bands) in the first-principles method are
illustrated by the calculation. Pressure ionization and thermal smearing are
shown as the major factors to prevent the deviation of pressure from global
accumulation along the Hugoniot. In addition, cancellation between electronic
kinetic pressure and virial pressure further reduces the deviation. The
calculation of X-ray absorption spectra shows that the band gap of KCl persists
after the pressure ionization of the $3p$ electrons of Cl and K taking place at
lower energy, which provides a detailed understanding to the evolution of
electronic structures of warm dense matter.

Transition to a Moist Greenhouse with CO$_2$ and solar forcing,"

",2016,"  Water-rich planets such as Earth are expected to become eventually
uninhabitable, because liquid water does not remain stable at the surface as
surface temperatures increase with the solar luminosity over time. Whether a
large increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO$_2$
could also destroy the habitability of water-rich planets has remained unclear.
We show with three-dimensional aqua-planet numerical experiments that
CO$_2$-induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar
forcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback. The
climate does not run away, but instead attains a new steady state with
global-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330 K. The upper atmosphere is
considerably moister in this warm steady state than in the reference climate,
implying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to
space. For either a certain range of elevated CO$_2$ concentrations or solar
irradiation, we find both cold and warm equilibrium states, implying that the
transition to the warm state may not simply be reversed by removing the
additional forcing.

",2023,"  Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational
quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. However, the
implementation of QAOA is limited due to the requirement that the problems be
mapped to Ising Hamiltonians and the nonconvex optimization landscapes.
Although the Ising Hamiltonians for many NP hard problems have been obtained, a
general method to obtain the Ising Hamiltonians for constrained combinatorial
optimization problems (CCOPs) has not yet been investigated. In this paper, a
general method is introduced to obtain the Ising Hamiltonians for CCOPs and the
Metropolis-Hastings warm-starting algorithm for QAOA is presented which can
provably converge to the global optimal solutions. The effectiveness of this
method is demonstrated by tackling the minimum weight vertex cover (MWVC)
problem, the minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem, and the maximal independent
set problem as examples. The Ising Hamiltonian for the MWVC problem is obtained
first time by using this method. The advantages of the Metropolis-Hastings
warm-starting algorithm presented here is numerically analyzed through solving
30 randomly generated MVC cases with 1-depth QAOA.

Fermi Resonance and the Quantum Mechanical Basis of Global Warming,"

",2024,"  Although the scientific principles of anthropogenic climate change are
well-established, existing calculations of the warming effect of carbon dioxide
rely on spectral absorption databases, which obscures the physical foundations
of the climate problem. Here we show how CO2 radiative forcing can be expressed
via a first-principles description of the molecule's key vibrational-rotational
transitions. Our analysis elucidates the dependence of carbon dioxide's
effectiveness as a greenhouse gas on the Fermi resonance between the symmetric
stretch mode $\nu_1$ and bending mode $\nu_2$. It is remarkable that an
apparently accidental quantum resonance in an otherwise ordinary three-atom
molecule has had such a large impact on our planet's climate over geologic
time, and will also help determine its future warming due to human activity. In
addition to providing a simple explanation of CO2 radiative forcing on Earth,
our results may have implications for understanding radiation and climate on
other planets.

",2021,"  This paper investigates the initial boundary value problem for a
non-stationary one-dimensional heat equation that simulates the temperature
distribution in freshwater ice near the Earth's poles. The mathematical model
has been constructed taking into account solid-liquid phase transitions. Data
from meteorological stations were used to determine the model parameters, with
the help of which the necessary physical and thermophysical characteristics of
the computational domain were obtained. For the numerical solution of the
problem, the finite volume method (FVM) was used. For the obtained periodic
regime, the temperature versus depth dependences for each month were plotted,
and the depth of the active layer, as well as the depth of zero annual
amplitudes were found for each meteorological station. A forecast of the ice
temperature regime for 2100 was modeled for three Representative Concentration
Pathway (RCP) scenarios of global warming: moderate RCP2.6, corresponding to
the current emissions of RCP7 and adopted at the Paris Agreement in 2015
RCP1.9. By analyzing the impact of an additional 0,5 degrees Celsius of warming
on other areas, a reduction in the full range of risks to humanity and the
planet as a whole becomes evident with the proper efforts of the global
community. Thus, the conducted modeling has confirmed the need to reduce the
rate of global warming.
